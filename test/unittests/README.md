# Unit Tests for CARDIAX Code

This directory, `unittests/`, contains unit tests for the CARDIAX code. The sections below explain how the unit tests are configured to run.

## How Unit Tests are Run

(Mention something here about how the module unittest identifies and how these get run)

## How to build bullet-proof code

(Here mention standard practices that should be followed to ensure that future updates to the code do not break anything that is existing)

## Automation of unittests

(Here outline how the format of unittests has been changed to automatically check new code. Note that this requires standardization of how material models are implemented in CARDIAX, amongst other things)
